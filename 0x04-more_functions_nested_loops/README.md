# 0x04. C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

This project explores the concept of functions, nested loops, and various aspects of C programming. Below, we provide an overview of the key topics covered in this project.

## Nested Loops

Nested loops are used to create complex patterns, process multi-dimensional arrays, and solve problems that involve multiple iterations. In this project, we utilize nested loops to generate intricate patterns and manipulate 2D arrays.

## Functions

Functions in C are modular blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They help organize and encapsulate code for better maintainability. Throughout this project, we create and use functions to perform various operations, such as calculating mathematical sequences or processing data.

## Declaration vs. Definition of a Function

In C, a function declaration informs the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters, while the definition provides the actual implementation. We distinguish between these two aspects when building our functions, ensuring that our code is both well-structured and efficient.

## Function Prototypes

Function prototypes are essential for declaring the interface of a function without providing its full implementation. We include function prototypes in header files to ensure proper function usage throughout our code.

## Scope of Variables

Variable scope defines where a variable is accessible in the code. We manage variable scope effectively, using local variables for limited visibility within specific functions and global variables when data needs to be shared across multiple parts of the program.

## GCC Flags

When compiling our C code, we utilize several GCC flags to ensure code quality and compatibility. These flags include:
- `-Wall`: Enables compiler warnings to catch potential issues.
- `-Werror`: Treats compiler warnings as errors, promoting clean code.
- `-pedantic`: Enforces adherence to the C standard, ensuring code portability.
- `-Wextra`: Provides additional compiler warnings to catch more issues.
- `-std=gnu89`: Specifies the C language standard, in this case, C89 (ANSI C).

## Header Files and #include

Header files contain function prototypes, type definitions, and macro definitions. We use `#include` directives to include these header files in our source code, enabling the use of functions and structures defined in libraries and other source files without duplicating their declarations.

This README.md serves as a guide to understanding the concepts and practices applied in this project. For detailed information and usage instructions, refer to the project's source code and documentation.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a learning resource for C programming and software development.
